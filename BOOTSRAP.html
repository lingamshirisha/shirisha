        my mother is a house wife, a lovely friend, a strict parent. Also, she takes cares of the need of the whole
        family.
        If there is anyone out there who loves us more than our mother is only God. Not just for my mother but for every
        mother out there who lives her life for her family deserves praiseworthy applause.</div>

        A good sister demonstrates qualities of honesty, loyalty and trustworthiness. She communicates with her siblings
        and doesn't forget what's important to them. As a sister, she's there in times of need and in times of
        celebration. Even from afar, simple acts can demonstrate your desire to be a better sister.</div>
