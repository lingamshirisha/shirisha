        <p>Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman FRS (/ˈrɑːmən/;[1] 7 November 1888 – 21 November 1970) was an Indian
            physicist
            known for his work in the field of light scattering.[2] Using a spectrograph that he developed, he and his
            student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, the deflected light
            changes
            its wavelength and frequency. This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light, which they
            called
            "modified scattering" was subsequently termed the Raman effect or Raman scattering. Raman received the 1930
            Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery and was the first Asian to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of
            science.[3]</p>
