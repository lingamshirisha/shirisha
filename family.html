    <h3>FATHER LOVE</h3>
    <p> the man of the house was both breadwinner and provider, while mothers — equipped with an inherent, biological
        ability to nurture — took on the role of caretaker. As a result, it was the mother (or another maternal figure
        like a grandmother, nurse, or nanny) who was there for her children every hour of the day, who dried her kids’
        tears and sang them to sleep. It was the mother who provided most of the physical and emotional support —
        hugging, kissing, cradling — that every child needs for healthy growth. For a good chunk of history, especially
        during the industrial era, fathers were relegated to the role of distant provider.</p>
    <h1>MOTHER LOVE</h1>
    <P>Mother is the most selfless person in this world who starts loving her children even before they come into this
        world. Nothing could be compared to a mother’s love in this world as it is the purest form of love. Mother is
        like an angel for her child, who always loves her child and supports him/her. For every child, his mother has a
        special place in his heart because she is the first person the child sees after his birth. This is the reason
        why a child and a mother have a special bond between them. But not all people are fortunate enough to have
        mother love in their life due to many reasons. Those who have their mother with them must love and respect her.
    </P>
    <h1>SISTER'S LOVE</h1>

    <P>ou fight. You play together. You “borrow” each other’s clothes. You tease each other. You get into your mom’s
        makeup. Growing up with a sister can be awesome, but it can also be annoying—like living with a BFF and the
        class mean girl all at once. Having a sister is probably the biggest love/hate relationship you’ll ever
        experience.

        Still, sisters have a bond like no other. Whether you’re the responsible big sister or the wild-child little
        sister, you know what you have is special—and no one else but you better mess with her</P>
